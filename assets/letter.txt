My love,

Before you came into my life, I was just a nerdy kid trying to understand the world.

I grew up loving books, ideas, and questions. But somewhere along the way, I slowly lost interest in almost everything. I’ve been an atheist for as long as I can remember, and I kept wondering what the meaning of life really was. When I found nihilism, it didn’t give me answers. It only made me feel emptier. I started believing that nothing truly mattered.

I remember how lost I was back then. During my 10th board exams, I even left answers blank on purpose because I kept thinking, “What’s the point?” I believed I’d end up in the same place no matter what I did. That’s how disconnected I was from life.

In 11th and 12th grade, I found a few friends who thought like me. They listened to my nerdy talks, read the same philosophies, and understood my way of thinking. It made life a little more bearable. But deep down, I was convinced of one thing — no girl would ever listen to my endless thoughts, and no woman would ever give my life meaning.

And then… you came.

You were curious about The Stranger. Not just the book itself, but why I loved it. You wanted to understand my mind. You wanted to understand me.

You sat there and listened to all my rambling — my philosophies, my doubts, my confusion, my chaos — and you never once made me feel strange for it.

That’s when something inside me changed.

You didn’t suddenly give me all the answers about life.
But you gave me something better.

You gave me a reason to care.
You gave me a reason to feel.
You gave me a reason to wake up and try.

I don’t believe in heaven.

But if heaven is a place where you feel understood, accepted, and truly loved…

Then you are my heaven.

Most people have a god to look up to when they feel lost or when they need purpose.
When I feel down… I look up to you.

You give me motivation.
You make me want to work harder.
You make me want to build a future where I can give you a comfortable, happy life.

So when I say you’re my goddess,
I truly mean it.

You didn’t save my life in some dramatic way.
You simply walked into it and made it worth living.

And for that, I will always love you.

Forever yours,
Karthick
